  ## Requirements
  Apart from the requirements.txt, this script makes heavy use of UNIX commands. Here are what you need:
  * A Valid SirHurt License
  * wget
  * unzip
  * winetricks
  
  (If you're using a beginner distro like Ubuntu, there's a high chance you already have those, except a SirHurt License of course.)
  
  ## Installation 
  Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/TuxHut/TuxHurt`<br/>
  Install the requirements with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`<br/>
  Download Sirhurt from the website and put the .zip archive next to run and setup scripts(The archive must be named "SirHurt V4.zip").<br/>
  Run the run.py script. This may take a while for the first time.<br/>

  ## Usage 
  You can simply use the `run.py` to run Sirhurt. It will automatically check updates for you too.<br/>
  `python3 run.py -u` to force update.<br/>
  `python3 run.py -c` to remove Sirhurt. This may be a bit buggy so if it breaks, just delete the `sirhurt` directory by hand.<br/>
  `python3 run.py -f` to fix Unexpected Client Behavior in Roblox.<br/>
  
  ## Injector 
  TuxHurt uses an Injector called TuxHut that is made by the Owners of TuxHurt. It is a big part of TuxHurt's 0 effort goal.<br/>
  Read more about the Injector [here](https://github.com/TuxHurt/TuxHut)
  
  ## SirHurtWine
  If you would like to run SirHurt on GNU/Linux without TuxHurt, read a guide created by use [here](https://hentai.dsf001.site/notes/sirhurt.html).<br/>
  It's recommended to run SirHurt on GNU/Linux with TuxHurt.
